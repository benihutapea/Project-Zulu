**Continue Phase 4C: Component Tests with React 18**

Context:
- Project: Zola (Next.js 15 AI chat interface)
- Branch: refactor/foundation (32 commits ahead)
- Location: /root/zola
- Status: Phase 4B ✅ COMPLETE (79 tests), Phase 4C ⚠️ BLOCKED

Phase 4B Results:
- ✅ 79 passing unit tests (165% of goal)
- ✅ Encryption tests: 25 tests (100% coverage)
- ✅ File handling tests: 24 tests (90% coverage)
- ✅ All tests passing in ~1.5s

Phase 4C Status:
- ⚠️ BLOCKED by React 19 compatibility
- 102 component tests written but cannot run
- Tests ready: Button (30), Input (33), Badge (39)
- Blocker: React.act not available in React 19.2.0

Session Plan:
1. Downgrade React 19 → React 18 stable
2. Run Phase 4C component tests
3. Verify all 102 tests pass
4. Continue with more component tests
5. Target: 30+ component tests passing

Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# 1. Downgrade to React 18
npm install react@18 react-dom@18 --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Verify installation
npm ls react react-dom

# 3. Run component tests
npm test -- __tests__/components/ui/

# 4. Run all tests
npm test

# 5. Check test summary
npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Suites:|Tests:|Time:"
```

Expected Results After Downgrade:
- React 18.x.x installed
- 102 component tests should pass
- Total: 181 tests (79 unit + 102 component)
- All tests passing

Files Already Created:
- `__tests__/components/ui/button.test.tsx` (30 tests)
- `__tests__/components/ui/input.test.tsx` (33 tests)
- `__tests__/components/ui/badge.test.tsx` (39 tests)

Next Steps After Tests Pass:
1. Commit successful test run
2. Add more component tests (dialog, select, etc.)
3. Move to Phase 4D (Integration Tests)
