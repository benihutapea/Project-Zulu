## ❌ Critical Issues Found

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Fix)

#### 1. TypeScript Errors (30+ errors)
```
Location: Multiple API routes and components
Impact  : Blocks production builds
Cause   : - Supabase type mismatches
          - Database schema inconsistencies
          - Missing type definitions
          - Generic 'any' types
          
Files Affected:
- app/api/chat/api.ts
- app/api/create-chat/api.ts
- app/api/create-guest/route.ts
- app/api/projects/route.ts
- app/api/user-preferences/route.ts
- app/api/rate-limits/api.ts
- (and 10+ more)

Solution: Regenerate Supabase types + fix type conflicts
Time    : 2-3 days
```

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY

#### 2. No Test Coverage (0%)
```
Current : 0 test files
Impact  : - Hard to refactor safely
          - No regression protection
          - Difficult to maintain
          - Risk of breaking changes

Recommended:
- Unit tests for utilities (80% target)
- Integration tests for APIs (70% target)
- Component tests for UI (60% target)
- E2E tests for critical flows

Time    : 3-5 days for initial setup
```

#### 3. Console Logs Everywhere (20+ files)
```
Found in:
- app/auth/callback/route.ts
- app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx
- app/api/*/route.ts (multiple)
- lib/api.ts
- components/*/\*.tsx (multiple)

Issue   : - Performance impact
          - Security risk (sensitive data in logs)
          - No structured logging
          - Can't disable in production

Solution: Replace with proper logger (pino/winston)
Time    : 1 day
```

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. Outdated Dependencies (14 packages)
```
Major Updates Available:
- @ai-sdk/* packages (v1 → v2)
- ai (v4 → v5)
- @supabase/ssr (v0.5 → v0.7)
- jsdom (v26 → v27)
- marked (v15 → v16)

Risk    : Security vulnerabilities, missing features
Time    : 1-2 days (test thoroughly)
```

#### 5. Code Quality Issues
```
- Large components (300+ lines)
- Duplicated code
- Mixed concerns
- No consistent error handling
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- 6 TODO comments not resolved
- 16 files using 'any' type

Time    : 5-7 days for major refactoring
```
