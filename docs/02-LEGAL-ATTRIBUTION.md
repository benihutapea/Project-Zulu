[Original Apache 2.0 License text follows...]
```

### Step 3: Update README

In your README.md, include clear attribution:

```markdown
# Your Project Name

> An enhanced, production-ready fork of Zola

This project is a fork of [Zola](https://github.com/ibelick/zola) 
by Julien Thibeaut, with significant enhancements and improvements.

## What's Different?

[Your improvements...]

## Original Project

Built upon the excellent foundation of:
- **Zola** by Julien Thibeaut
- License: Apache 2.0
- Original: https://github.com/ibelick/zola

## Attribution

See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for complete attribution and changes.

  "author": {

    "email": "your@email.com",
    "url": "https://your-website.com"
  },
  "contributors": [
    "Julien Thibeaut <email> (Original Author)",

    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/your-project"
  },
  "license": "Apache-2.0"
}
```

## 🎨 Branding Strategy

### Rename Your Fork

**Don't use**: "Zola", "Zola Chat", "Zola AI"  
**Do use**: Your own unique name

Good examples:
- "ChatCraft" (your name + craft)
- "AIForge" (your name + forge)
- "ConvoHub" (your name + hub)
- "Zola Enhanced" (okay, but less distinctive)

### Visual Identity

1. **Logo**: Create your own (don't copy Zola's)
2. **Colors**: Use different brand colors
3. **Font**: Can keep or change
4. **Favicon**: Create your own

### Marketing Copy

**Don't say**:
- "This is Zola"
- "The official Zola"
- "Zola by [Your Name]"

**Do say**:
- "Based on Zola"
- "Fork of Zola with enhancements"
- "[Your Project] - Enhanced Zola fork"
- "Built on Zola's foundation"

### Contribution Opportunities

Consider contributing back:
