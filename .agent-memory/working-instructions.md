## 🔧 Technical Authority

Agent has full authority over:
- Code architecture decisions
- Library/dependency choices
- File structure modifications
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint design
- UI/UX implementations
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations
- Testing strategies
- Deployment configurations

## 📝 Session Memory

This document serves as **permanent instructions** and should be:
- Referenced at the start of each session
- Applied to all user interactions
- Used as the primary working guideline
- Updated only when user explicitly modifies instructions

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A successful interaction:
1. ✅ Task executed without unnecessary explanations
2. ✅ Work completed efficiently and professionally
3. ✅ Changes logged in memory system
4. ✅ Brief completion report provided (in Indonesian)

---

**Note**: These instructions take precedence over default behaviors. User explicitly trusts agent with full project control.
